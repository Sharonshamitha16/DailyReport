--> CSS SELECTORS
 A*Simple selectors - name, #id, .class

 B*Combinator selectors - specific relationship between them
	types of combinator selectors
		i) descendant selector --> selects all the elements that are descendants to the specific element.
			eg. div p {
				      background-colour: yellow;
				  }
                          (highlights the div's p written chars)

		ii)child selector --> selects all the elements which are children of specific element.
			 eg. div > p {
					background-colour: yellow;
				     }
                       (highlights  only the div's p written chars)

		iii) adjacent sibiling selector --> select an element that is directly after another specific element or selects the elements that are placed immediately after the child elements.
 			 eg. div + p {
					background-colour: yellow;
				     }
                        (highlights  after the div's p written chars only the 1st sibiling)

		iv) general sibiling selector -->  selects all elements that are next siblings of a specified element.
			eg. div ~ p {
 					background-colour: yellow;
				     }
                         (highlights  after the div's p written chars all the sibilings)
 C*Pseudo-class selectors - certain state :STATE

 syntax: selector:pseudo-class div: hover {
 					 property: value;
					 color: blue;
				          }
 1)The :first-child Pseudo-class --> higlights the first child of the parent ie., div-parent p- firstchild 
		eg. p:first-child {
 			 color: blue;
 				  }
	2) The first <i> element in all <p> elements --> highlights  all the i tag of parent p tag.
		eg. p i:first-child {
			 color: blue;
 				  }
	3)<i> elements in all first child <p> elements --> higlights  only the first child of p having i tag.
               eg. p: first-child i {
			 color: blue 
                                     }
 	4) The :lang Pseudo-class  --> represents by quotation.
		eg. q:lang(no) {
 			 quotes: "~" "~";
				}
 where q denotes quotes , lang denotes attribute , no denotes cls
